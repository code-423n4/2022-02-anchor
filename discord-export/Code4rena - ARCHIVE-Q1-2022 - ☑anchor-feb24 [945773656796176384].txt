How to start in Web3 hacking on Rust-based chains?  

Web3 is more than EVM and Solidity. Hence, here are some foundations that you need to start hacking on Rust chains!🦀

You may treat this thread as an addition to the fantastic @adrianhetman's tweet.

Nope. It's counterproductive at this point.

**A couple of notes about these awards:**
1. While the contest awards were advertised in UST, C4 converted the UST funds to USDC for $0.89 on the dollar when UST started to decline in value. Therefore, all amounts shown here are in USDC (converted at the same rate we received), and funds will be paid out in USDC.
2. Judging and triage fees were paid out of the total award pool for this contest.
